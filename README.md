# Pizza Sales SQL Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to uncover key business insights.  
It includes queries for:
- **Average Daily Orders** â€“ Calculates the average number of pizzas sold per day.
- **Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue** â€“ Identifies the best-selling pizza types based on total revenue.
- **Cumulative Revenue Over Time** â€“ Tracks sales growth using SQL window functions.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **order_details.csv** â€“ Contains pizza order quantities and IDs.
- **orders** â€“ Order date and ID details.
- **pizzas** â€“ Pizza price and type identifiers.
- **pizza_types** â€“ Names and categories of pizzas.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible syntax)
- **Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions**

## ðŸ“Š Key Queries
1. **Average pizzas ordered per day** â€“ Uses `AVG()` and subqueries.  
2. **Top 3 pizzas by revenue** â€“ Combines joins and `GROUP BY` with `ORDER BY LIMIT`.  
3. **Cumulative revenue analysis** â€“ Implements `SUM() OVER()` for running totals.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Import dataset into your SQL database.
2. Run each `.sql` file:
   - `10.sql` â†’ Average daily orders.
   - `11.sql` â†’ Top pizzas by revenue.
   - `13.sql` â†’ Cumulative revenue analysis.
3. View results for business decision-making.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Insights
- The business can identify high-performing products.
